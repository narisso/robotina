# a* algorithm
"""
A* uses a best-first search and finds the least-cost path from a given 
initial node to one goal node (out of one or more possible goals).
 
It uses a distance-plus-cost heuristic function (usually denoted f(x)) to 
determine the order in which the search visits nodes in the tree. The 
distance-plus-cost heuristic is a sum of two functions:
 
    * the path-cost function, which is the cost from the starting node to 
      the current node (usually denoted g(x))
 
    * and an admissible "heuristic estimate" of the distance to the goal 
      (usually denoted h(x)).
 
The h(x) part of the f(x) function must be an admissible heuristic; that is,
it must not overestimate the distance to the goal. Thus, for an application 
like routing, h(x) might represent the straight-line distance to the goal, 
since that is physically the smallest possible distance between any two 
points or nodes.
 
If the heuristic h satisfies the additional condition h(x) \le d(x,y) + h(y)
for every edge x, y of the graph (where d denotes the length of that edge),
then h is called monotone, or consistent. In such a case, A* can be 
implemented more efficiently roughly speaking, no node needs to be 
processed more than once (see closed set below)and A* is equivalent to 
running Dijkstra's algorithm with the reduced cost 
d'(x,y): = d(x,y) - h(x) + h(y).
 
Note that A* has been generalized into a bidirectional heuristic search 
algorithm; see bidirectional search.
